SSU is a unit testing framework for Korn Shell and Bourne Shell. This tool is able to used like xUnit. Additionally, it has many following functions for:
  * validation
  * restoring a testing environment
  * code coverage
  * utilities
  * debug mode
  * particularly running

As a future work, ssu will have AOP... maybe ;-)
